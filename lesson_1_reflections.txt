How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I can see exact line number and changed text 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can go back to any previous version

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros:
	commit only when I think the text is ready
	no unneeded work-in-progress versions
    Cons:
	need to remember about commiting
	takes additional seconds to do

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is for software projects while Google Docs are for office documents

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Use git log to search for desired commit by description
    Use git diff to search differences between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can go back and forward to any version without any problem

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
